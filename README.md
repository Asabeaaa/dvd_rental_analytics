# DVD Rental Analytics

This is an analytics pipeline built on the DVD rental dataset. It connects to a PostgreSQL database, validates and explores the data, builds merged datasets for analysis, and produces insights across customer behaviour, revenue, and inventory. The results are then displayed through a multi-page Streamlit dashboard.

---

## Setup

### System Requirements

- Minimum: 4 GB RAM, 2 GB disk space (Recommended: 8 GB RAM, 5 GB disk space)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- DVD rental backup file

### Database Setup

Start PostgreSQL and pgAdmin using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Restore the DVD rental database using the provided script:

```bash
bash scripts/00_restore_dvdrental_docker.sh
```

The script copies the backup into the container, creates the `dvdrental` database, restores it, and runs a quick row count check to confirm the restore was successful.

Access pgAdmin at `http://localhost:5050` using the credentials in your `.env` file.

### Python Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Environment Variables

```dotenv
# PostgreSQL (Docker)
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=
POSTGRES_PORT=

# pgAdmin (Docker)
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=
PGADMIN_PORT=

# Application
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_USER=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=
```

---

## Running the Project

Run each script in order:

```bash
python 1_setup_validate.py      # connect, validate, and report on the database
python 2_data_exploration.py    # exploratory data analysis and visualizations
python 3_data_relationships.py  # build and validate merged datasets
python 4_analysis.py            # advanced analytics across specific themes
streamlit run 5_dashboard.py    # launch the dashboard
```

---

## Docker

To build and run the full pipeline in a container:

```bash
docker build -t dvd_rental_analytics .
docker run --env-file .env dvd_rental_analytics
```

This runs all scripts in order and launches the Streamlit dashboard on port 8501. Make sure **DB_HOST** in your **.env** is set to **dvd_rental_postgres** instead of **127.0.0.1** when running inside Docker, so the container can reach the database over the Docker network.

## Data Description

The DVD rental dataset models a physical video rental store with 15 tables.

### Critical Tables

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| **film** | Film catalogue. Includes title, rental rate, rental duration, replacement cost, and rating. |
| **customer** | Registered customers. Includes name, email, store assignment, and active status. |
| **rental** | One row per rental transaction. Links a customer to an inventory item with rental and return dates. |
| **payment** | One row per payment. Linked to a rental, records the amount and payment date. |
| **inventory** | Physical copies of films. Each copy is assigned to a store. |
| **store** | Store records. Each store has a managing staff member and an address. |

### Reference and Bridge Tables

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| **actor** | Actor names. |
| **film_actor** | Bridge table linking films to actors. |
| **category** | Film categories such as Action, Comedy, and Horror. |
| **film_category** | Bridge table linking films to categories. |
| **language** | Languages. Referenced by film. |
| **staff** | Staff members. Each is assigned to a store. |
| **address** | Addresses for customers, staff, and stores. |
| **city** | Cities. Referenced by address. |
| **country** | Countries. Referenced by city. |

### Key Relationships

**rental** is the central transaction table. Every rental links a **customer** to an **inventory** item. **inventory** connects to **film** and **store**. **payment** is recorded separately and links back to **rental**, which means a rental row can exist without a corresponding payment row if the customer has not yet returned the film.
